                <p>To condense all of Mr Nelson Mandela's achievements into one chronology would be impossible; as a result, this work cannot be termed comprehensive. 
                    Below you will find a chronology of important events in the life of Nelson Mandela. 
                    It is a work in progress and we are happy to receive your comments or additions.
